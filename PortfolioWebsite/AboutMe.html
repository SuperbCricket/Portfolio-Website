                <h2>
                    I'm Gerben Prins working towards becoming a game developer. I live in the Netherlands close to Amsterdam where I 
                    study game development/programming. Video Games have always caught my attention and I've always wanted to be able to make them.
                    I am pretty much interested in every aspect of video games but I'm mostly skilled at unity and C#.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Next to Programming I'm also learning pixel art like the art you see in the background. Currently I’m learning 
                    to make neon style art, because that’s what my current project is going to be styled with. I’m also a big fan of post-apocalyptic.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    When it comes to games: I’m mostly interested in platformers and usually play precision platformers like Celeste or Mario 
                    kaizo/ Rom hacks because I like the challenge. However, most of the time I like to relax and play something less complicated.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Don’t worry though I would love to develop other things as well and expand my knowledge even further until I can gladly 
                    tell someone to play a game I worked on for years!
