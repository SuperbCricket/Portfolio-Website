                <h2>
                    I'm Gerben Prins working towards becoming a game developer. I live in the Netherlands close to Amsterdam where I right now 
                    study game development/programming. Video Games have always caught my attention and I've always wanted to be able to make them.
                    I am pretty much interested in every aspect of Video games but am mostly Skilled With unity and C#.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Next to Programming I also try and learn pixel art like the art you see in the background. Currently I’m trying to learn how 
                    to make neon style art because that’s what my current project is going to be about but I’m also a big fan of post-apocalyptic.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    When it comes to games: I’m mostly interested in platformers and usually play precision platformers like Celeste or Mario 
                    kaizo/ Rom hacks because I like the challenge but a lot of the times I like to relax as well and play something less complicated.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Don’t worry though I would love to develop other things as well and expand my knowledge even further until I can gladly 
                    tell someone to play a game I worked on for years!
