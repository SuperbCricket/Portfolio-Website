            <h2>
                Hi and welcome to my website, I'm Gerben Prins working towards becoming a game developer.
                I live in the Netherlands close to Amsterdam where I right now study game development/programming. 
            </h2>
            <h2>
                Video Games have always cought my attention and I've always wanted to be able to make them. Because of
                this I am trying to learn how to develop games myself and am I interested in pretty much every aspect 
                of the game development proces.
            </h2>
            <h2>
                Next to game Programming I also try and learn pixel art (mostly in Neon or Post Apocalyptic style) and Game music/atmosphere.
                because I want to learn more about other perspectives of game development as well.
            </h2>
            <h2>
                Because of my interest in more aspects of game development I do prefer working in small teams or small companies because
                I most likely get more opertunities to work on many different things instead of heaving to do the same process of work 
                over and over again.
