                <h2>
                    This project is my most recent project and I am still working on it trying to improve its movement and what not. 
                    It all started with me wanting to be able to make a proper State Machine. Further, I wanted to improve my capabilities of 
                    movement and animations. This game is supposed to become a precise platformer with many possibilities in terms of momentum and speed.

                This is where all the state machine magic happens! The image you see above is a visual sheet of all the states and their transitions. 
                The icons on the left showcase the conditions for one state to switch to another. The player will start in the idle state which gets 
                called from the Player class/script.

                Movement
            </h3>
            <h2>
                Most people seem to underestimate making movement for platformer games. They don't realize that making 
                a proper platformer doesn't only require making a simple jump and walking script. To accomplish smooth gameplay a lot more 
                moves need to be added. One of these moves is called a Coyote Jump which makes it possible for the player to jump for a short 
                amount of time after walking of a platform. This is very important if you want your game to feel more forgivable. Another move 
                that can improve your platformer a lot is the jump buffer. This creates a short window to press the jump button before the 
                player lands. This causes the player to jump right when he lands. As a result you can jump slightly early without being 
                punished by mis-inputting too often.

                Pixel Snapping
            </h3>
            <h2>
                My game is made in pixel art and one thing I wanted to avoid from the start is that the player would be able to stand “between 
                pixels” when moving. I fixed this problem by changing the resolution of the game window to the set amount of pixels per unit (which 
                is 48). Now the player will snap on the pixels (shown on the right) even though the player is technically not exactly in that 
                spot in the editor (shown on the left).

                Tile Rules

            <h2>
                I decided to make a tile rule system in my game because I think I'm going to have to place a lot of tiles to make a proper platformer.
                Making this system took a long time but I feel like it will be worth it when I start doing level design. I hope to eventually save
                time with this but we'll see.

                I created some animations for the main character to make the movement feel more fluid!
