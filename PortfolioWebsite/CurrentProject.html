                    This project is my most recent project and I am as of now still working on it to try and 
                    improve it's movement and what not. It all statred with me wanting to be able to make a proper State Machine
                    (which you can read more about below) to improve my capabilities of movement and animations. This game is supposed
                    to become a precise platformer with many possibilities in temrs of momentum and speed.

            <h2>
                This is where all the state machine magic happens! The Image you see above is the Start Function in the Player 
                Class/Script. In this picture you can see that I've written down all the Transitions between states with a 
                specific value. all these transitions will be put into a list by the PlayerStateMachine Class/Script. 
                The PlayerStateMachine Class/Script will than check in which state the player is which at the start will be Idle
                because that's what we Initialize in the Player Class/ Script. after this it will check with a for each loop if a transition
                that starts from the Current State (in our case Idle) has all it's vallues set to true. If this is the case it will 
                change the current state in the ChangeState function.

                Reading this out loud makes it sound very complicated so if you want to see my Scripts you can find them at the bottom of this page
