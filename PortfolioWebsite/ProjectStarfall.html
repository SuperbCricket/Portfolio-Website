                    This is a 2D Metroidvenia project I worked on in college for about a year which has been in development by Neon Origins. This 
                    is an Indy company which specializes in teaching new game developers how to work on big projects in large teams.

                Moving Platform Momentum
            </h3>
            <h2>
                The first user story I worked on was about applying moving platform momentum to the player momentum. This makes it possible for the 
                player to stand still on the platform when it is moving. Its momentum is used to jump further or higher depending on the 
                speed.
            </h2>
            <h2>
                In the picture above you can see a drawn visual sheet which showcases how the player reacts/ can react to the moving platform
                momentum. The red arrows show the momentum the player gets when they got on top of a moving platform. The green arrow shows 
                the player momentum (think of walking or jumping).

            <h3>
                Checkpoint System
            </h3>
            <h2>
                Creating the checkpoint system was a lot more complicated than expected. Coding a checkpoint doesn't sound super complicated but
                I couldn't just start coding like usual because me and the team weren't sure how the it was going to be made.
                We decided to create a small group to discuss about what the best options would be for our checkpoint system. Eventually we all
                agreed to a system that would work for the game making it possible for me to start coding it.
            </h2>
            <h2>
                The checkpoints have three states. The first state is called "Deactive" which means the player hasn't reached the checkpoint yet.
                The second state is the "Active State" which means the checkpoint is the last checkpoint the player activated. The last state is 
                called the "Idle State" which means the checkpoint was activated by the player but isn't the last checkpoint the player activated.
            </h2>
            <h2>
                This was useful because we wanted to make a system in the future that warps players to previously activated checkpoints. This makes it
                possible for the player to traverse through the game more quickly and find new areas without getting bored of backtracking.

            <h3>
                Residual Jump Force
            </h3>
            <h2>
                Our team eventually decided to do a user test to figure out how players would experience our game and all its mechanics/ features. A
                complaint we heard a lot is "The jump doesn't feel very responsive" which was probably true, but the game already had a jump buffer and 
                coyote jump. When looking at our users' gameplay we realized that players would usually jump too high because our game didn't have 
                any controlled jump height. This is why I decided to work on a residual jump force system which makes it possible for the player to jump 
                less high when the player presses the jump button for a short amount of time.
            </h2>
            <h2>
                I created the residual jump force system by checking if the player stopped pressing the jump button while the player was still jumping. I added
                a force downwards in this situation to cancel the jump without the player losing all their momentum out of nowhere.
