                    my goal with programming is being able to make a fluid platformer since plafromers have 
                    been my favourite type of games throughout my whole life. Eventhough this game is still in 
                    early development I've been liking a lot of challanges and tools that I used to build this game.

                Mono Crow is the first Unity game I build and is still very intersting to me. Eventhough this game has many flaws 
                it still is a fun game to look around in. My favourite part about this game was building the "Crow" and figuring out
                how I could make it fly to random direction to try and find the player. Click <a href="PorfolioProjects.html">here</a> for more information.

            Starfall Is a project from college that I got to work on With a small team of other students for a couple of months.
            This project has teached me a lot about working together in a team and how it feels to be working on a large project.
