            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <h2>
                A Platformer seems like a pretty easy game to buid for most people, which might be true but making a platform 
                feel good takes a lot of practice. Most people think a platform just exists out of Jumping and walking, but this is not always the case.

            <h2>
                This Project is no meant to become a game at all but mostly to test and theorize movement so that I'll be able to use this knowledge
                to build good movement in the future.

            <h1>State Machine</h1>
            <h2>
                The first step to making a good platformer is making a state machine that can tell other movement related scripts
                in what the state will be. this is very important. Because without a proper state machine a players might be able to do things
                you don't want them to. for example: Jumping while being airborn.

                Starfall Is a project from college that I got to work on With a small team of other students for a couple of months.
                This project has teached me a lot about working together in a team and how it feels to be working on a large project.
