                Some of you might know this already but I’ve been noting down all my video game challenges, 
                accomplishments and speedruns since early 2022 and have been keeping up with this till today. I also 
                write down challenges and speedruns which I’m still planning to complete one day to make sure I always 
                know what I can still do when I’m not sure what games to play. I started writing down these 
                accomplishments on a paper in 2022 but changed quickly no a txt file. After my txt file I changed to a 
                Trello website which worked pretty well for a bit but got a bit chaotic at some point. And now I keep 
                them in an excel sheet which a link to can be found below. I think excel looks kind of ugly I though so 
                I decided: maybe I should make a website for it. This website is a little outdated though because I 
                update it once every month so the excel sheet is still more up to date at this point.

                I’ve divided my statistics in 4 pages: Top 10, Accomplishments, Speedruns and Challenges

            <h2>
                On the Top 10 page I’ll explain my 10 most difficult accomplishments/ speedruns I’ve achieved. 
                These are my proudest achievements as of now and most of them took a very long time
            </h2>
            <h2>
                On the Accomplishments Page you can see every (worthy to mention) accomplishments I’ve achieved from 
                the most insane to the easiest challenges out there with a short explanation
            </h2>
            <h2>
                On the Speedruns page you’ll find every speedrun I’m planning on doing, What times I’ve set on 
                some of them and if they are submitted or not
            </h2>
            <h2>
                On the Challenges page you can find all the challenges I’m still planning on doing and their difficulty 
                from hardest to easiest. This page is always a bit messy because I remove a lot of the challenges if I 
                realize they aren’t fun and also add a lot of stuff. this one might be the most outdated out of everything
                 but it’s still fun to take a look sometimes

            <h2>
                PS: all the speedruns/ accomplishments I’ve done live have a link to them as well so if you want to see 
                those you can!
