                Hi Cricket here,
            </h3>
            <h2>
                My real Name is Gerben (he/him) but most people call me Jordon. This is because people can’t pronounce 
                my name right usually. I was born in 2005 and live in the Netherlands somewhere close to Amsterdam where
                I usually live behind my pc to play games, develop Games, make video game mods and sometimes websites. 
                I learn about programming in college and go there about 30-40 hours a week. Next to college I of course
                do streaming and video editing, but I also play keyboard sometimes and go running. I’d love to get a job
                in game development one day. I’m mostly skilled at coding with forces/ movement for players or enemies 
                and mostly develop in Unity

                More about Games,
            </h3>
            <h2>
                I grew up playing a bunch of video games and got my first console with the age of 6. My first console 
                was a Nintendo Wii which I got with Mario Kart Wii, Mario galaxy, Mario Galaxy 2 and Mario Bros Wii. I
                 usually played these games for pretty short amounts of time because I was young and my parents didn’t 
                 want me to get addicted to video games at such a young age. This didn’t stop me from playing video games 
                 though and I would usually write down plans on what to do when I had time to play again. I’ve always 
                 kind of kept this way of playing video games and to this day write down everything I’m planning to do 
                 even though I have a lot more time on my hands. I now own a Wii U and a Switch which I don’t use that 
                 much but sometimes I feel like playing some Mario games, Zelda Games or some other Nintendo exclusives. 
                 I mostly play on my pc however where I play mostly Celeste, Spelunky 2, Rain World and Hollow Knight 
                 which yeah… are mostly platformers.
