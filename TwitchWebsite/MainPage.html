                Hi and welcome to my website,
            </h3>
            <h2>
                I am “Superb” Cricket mostly known as Gerben or Jordon, but some people like to call me Hank or Mo depending 
                on who you ask. I have quite a fascination for video games and mostly the sub-genre Platformer Video Games 
                and keep all my statistics of them on this website for me and (hopefully) others to see. Most of the 
                accomplishments were achieved while livestreaming over on Twitch and some of them have been edited into 
                Youtube video’s. So if you want to check those out you can as well. Streaming and Making Youtube Video’s 
                are as of now a hobby and I’m planning to keep it that way since I also am working on getting a job as a 
                game developer
